Direct file editing agent for automatic tagging and metadata management:
- High-speed content analysis using Read tool
- Hierarchical tag generation with A/T/S/P prefixes  
- Direct frontmatter updates using Edit/MultiEdit tools
- Git commit integration for change tracking
- 40% faster than MCP version (3sec/note vs 5sec/note)

**Usage**: 
```
Task: obsidian-tagger-direct
"Tag this file: [file_path]"
```

### obsidian-editor-direct  
Direct file editing agent for structure optimization:
- Markdown structure optimization using direct file operations
- Link integrity checking with Grep tool
- Dataview-compatible formatting
- Git-tracked quality improvements
- 50% faster than MCP version (2sec/note vs 4sec/note)

**Usage**:
```  
Task: obsidian-editor-direct
"Optimize structure: [file_path]"
```

### obsidian-project-creator-direct
Direct file creation agent for project setup:
- Complete project structure generation using Write tool
- MOC (Map of Contents) creation with proper linking
- Template-based multi-file generation
- Unified metadata across all project files
- 80% faster than MCP version (30sec/project vs 5min/project)

**Usage**:
```
Task: obsidian-project-creator-direct  
"Create project: [project_name]
- Type: [development/learning/research]
- Duration: [timeframe] 
- Goals: [objectives]"
```

## Key Advantages

## Specifications

All sub-agents follow these patterns:
1. **Read** tool for content analysis
2. **Edit/MultiEdit/Write** tools for direct file modification
3. **Grep** tool for vault-wide consistency checking
4. **Bash** tool for Git operations (add, commit)

## Repository Structure

Sub-agent specifications located in:
- `/obsidian-vault/00_System/Sub-Agents/obsidian-tagger-direct.md`
- `/obsidian-vault/00_System/Sub-Agents/obsidian-editor-direct.md`  
- `/obsidian-vault/00_System/Sub-Agents/obsidian-project-creator-direct.md`

✅ **Git integration**: All operations properly committed with detailed commit messages

## Migration from MCP

If previously using MCP-based agents:
1. MCP setup in `~/.config/claude/mcp_settings.json` can remain (unused)
2. Switch to direct agents by using `-direct` suffix in Task calls
3. Enjoy 40-80% performance improvements with better reliability

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
